        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Alfredo sauce is a creamy, rich Italian sauce made primarily of butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese. It's known for its 
            smooth, velvety texture and indulgent flavor. To make it, butter is melted in a pan, then heavy cream is added and simmered until
            it thickens. Grated Parmesan cheese is stirred in until it melts, creating a luscious, cheesy sauce. Garlic, salt, and pepper are
            often used to season it, and some recipes also include a touch of nutmeg for warmth. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Alfredo sauce is typically served with pasta, especially fettuccine, creating the classic dish <strong>Fettuccine Alfredo</strong>. It can also be 
            used as a base for other dishes, like chicken Alfredo or shrimp Alfredo, and is often topped with fresh herbs or additional grated 
            cheese. Its creamy, cheesy flavor is a favorite comfort food for many!
